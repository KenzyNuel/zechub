# Zcash Development Fund

Zcash is a unique blockchain protocol because it is self-funded. This means that teams working on Zcash do not need to take money from outsider investors, and can remain focused on driving adoption while also staying aligned with Zcash's broader ethos and mission.

## Block Rewards

In blockchains, there are something called a [blocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-bitcoin-block.asp), which are produced to record transactions that are not yet confirmed in the network. Once transactions are validated, the block is closed.

Block producers (aka miners) are tasked with validating transactions in a network and producing new blocks. When producing these blocks, block producers are rewarded with a block reward. In Zcash, roughly every 75 seconds a new block is produced, and a block reward of 3.125 ZEC comes into circulation. Block rewards in Zcash will produce new coins until Zcash reaches its 21 million max supply. After reaching max supply, block rewards will be paid for by transaction fees.

## Zcash's funding mechanism (pre NU6)

In Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all of the block rewards go to block producers. Zcash is unique in the fact that 20% of the block reward is transferred to the [Zcash development fund](https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014). This fund funds the teams working on the Zcash protocol.

Currently, [Zcash Community Grants](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/) receives 8% of block rewards, Electric Coin Co. receives 7%, and the Zcash Foundation receives 5%. This works out to 40%, 35%, and 25% of the development fund respectively.

In 2020, the Zcash community voted on the development fund and the teams supported by it. In 2024, the community will vote again to determine who gets funding from the development fund.


# Zcash Dev Fund Lockbox (NU6)

The 20% Dev Fund Lockbox is the funding mechanism chosen for the next generation of the Zcash development fund. This option allocates 20% of Zcash block rewards to a selected lockbox, guaranteeing that resources are available to support the Zcash ecosystem's continuing development and upkeep.

## Decision-Making Process

The decision to implement the 20% Dev Fund Lockbox was reached through a comprehensive community-driven process. This included two rounds of Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) polls, as well as several ecosystem-wide polls. These polls allowed a broad spectrum of stakeholders to voice their opinions and contribute to the decision-making process.

### Round 1: ZCAP Poll
The initial round of polling involved members of the ZCAP. This group, comprised of various community members, was tasked with evaluating several proposals for the future of the dev fund. The first round of voting helped narrow down the options to the most viable and popular choices.
The following table is the result of member voting for the approval of each of the six ideas for a new Dev Fund, as well as for allowing the present Dev Fund to finish without establishing a new Dev Fund.

### Ecosystem Polls
Following the initial ZCAP poll, additional polls were conducted across the wider Zcash ecosystem. These polls aimed to capture a more extensive range of opinions from miners, developers, users, and other stakeholders. The input from these ecosystem polls was crucial in understanding the broader community's preferences and concerns.

### Round 2: ZCAP Poll
A second round of ZCAP polling was conducted to finalize the decision. This round focused on the refined options that emerged from the first round and the ecosystem polls. The 20% Dev Fund Lockbox option emerged as the preferred choice, reflecting a consensus among the various stakeholders.
